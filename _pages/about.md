I am currently a __Staff Research Engineer/Scientist__ at [InnoPeak Technology, Inc.](https://www.innopeaktech.com/) (a.k.a OPPO US Research Center) where I am working on R&D for XR (AR/VR/MR) related projects.
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Adelaide, where I work with [Prof. Ian Reid](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ianr/) @ Uni.Adelaide and [Dr. Hamid Rezatofighi](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/hamid-rezatofighi) @ Monash University.
I was associated with [The Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/) @ UniAdelaide 
and [Vision & Learning for Autonomous AI Lab(VL4AI)](https://vl4ai.erc.monash.edu/index.html) @ Monash University.
My research interests include deep learning and its application in 3D vision and robotic vision. 

Piror to that, I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Adelaide and I was affiliated with the [Australian Centre for Robotic Vision](https://www.roboticvision.org/), where I was advised by [Prof. Ian Reid](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~ianr/) and [Prof. Gustavo Carneiro](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~carneiro/). 
Previously, I received my B.Eng degree in Electronic Engineering (first class honors) from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/). 
Also, I was a visiting researcher in the [Unmanned Systems Research Group](http://uav.ece.nus.edu.sg/) at The National University of Singapore, where I worked with [Prof. Ben M. Chen](http://uav.ece.nus.edu.sg/~bmchen/).
